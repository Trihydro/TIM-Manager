     * and selected downstream node are checked to determine their offset distance
     * from the projected straight line path. If an intermediate node is offset too
     * far from the straight line path (i.e. greater than distance parameter) then
     * the selected downstream node is too far and the previous selected node is
     * picked as the next initial node as well as recording this previous selected
     * node in the minimum path list. This downstream walk and projection is
     * repeated from the newly selected initial node.
