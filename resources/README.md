The following .jar files will need to be present in this repository for the dev container to function as expected:

1. jpo-ode-common-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
2. jpo-ode-core-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
3. jpo-ode-plugins-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
4. jpo-ode-svcs.jar
5. postgresql-42.6.0.jar
6. ucp.jar

The jpo-ode .jar files are the output of compiling the jpo-ode project which can be found at https://github.com/usdot-jpo-ode/jpo-ode/tree/jpo-ode-2.0.0.
These files were not included in this repository due to GitHub file storage limitations.

The ucp.jar and postgresql-42.6.0.jar files have been provided for you.
